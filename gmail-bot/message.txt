Hello,

This is an automated email sent from a robot. The message sent was read from a plain text file.

If you would like to use bold, italics, or colored text in your email message you can write your own HTML in the code in main.py with the BODY_HTML global variable

Links should still work through this text file though, i.e. https://www.rshand.com

Kind regards,
Ryan
